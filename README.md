# LendingClub



Project Overview
Lending Club is seeking the expertise of a data science consultant
to perform comprehensive data cleaning, exploratory data
analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling on their loan application
dataset. The project will also explore the potential for deploying 
a real-time scoring application. The primary objective is to prepare
the dataset for accurate analysis and modeling, understand the
key variables influencing loan approval, and recommend a
predictive model for classifying loan applications.
